## Description

This was a cross course assignment, that started as a design CA, then evolved into an HTML&CSS CA, and finally we added JavaScript to create an interactive online store to display products from an API endpoint.
The goal was to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client (fictional) - SquareEyes.

Apart from CSS following DRY principles and semantic HTML, some JavaScript functionality includes: 

- Filtering products.
- Viewing a single product page with more detail.
- Adding and removig a products to/from cart.
- Viewing a summary of the cart on the checkout page.
- Viewing an order-confirmation screen after checking out.
